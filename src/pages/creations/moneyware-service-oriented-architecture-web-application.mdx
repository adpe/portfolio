title: 'Moneyware: Service-Oriented-Architecture Web application'
description: >-
  The accounting department of a company has a payroll accounting system that is
  based on various applications for the management of personnel data and the
  recording of working times. At the moment, the accounting department has to
  read the data manually from the two applications and calculate them manually
  in the monthly closing.


  For this purpose, an application is to be created that automatically generates
  the monthly statement from the data and displays it as required.

This project was done from February to May 2015 as part of the `Service-Oriented-Architecture` elective module. The project was done with my teammate which had more experience than me at this time. It was fascinating to work with him and benefit from his knowledge.

Tech Stack:

* Grails (Groovy)
* H2 (Java SQL database)
* REST (API)

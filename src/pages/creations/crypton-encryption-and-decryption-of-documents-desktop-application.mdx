  Currently, the company stores all customer-related documents in unencrypted
  form on a network drive located within the company's own premises. The company
  would like to store these documents in encrypted form in the future.


  The company doesn't want to use existing encryption software because it
  considers it too complex and does not want to overburden its staff with the
  complexities of encryption and data security.

#### What is Moodle?

**Moodle** is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators and learners with a single robust, secure and integrated system to create personalised learning environments.

#### Why Moodle?

Due to my professional activity, my interest in this open source project has increased. I try to get involved in this community as much as possible.

For all interested developers there is a Telegram [Moodle Dev Chat](https://telegram.me/moodledev).

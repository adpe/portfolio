#### Moodle Developers

Moodle lives from contributions, but the main core is mainly maintained by Moodle HQ. For all interested people, on this
[page](https://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php?version=x.x.x) you can see all developers that have ever contributed to this gorgeous project.

#### What about me?

Me, for my part have only done yet one contribution. My contributions can be found under this
[link](https://moodle.org/dev/gitcommits.php?version=x.x.x\&userid=2177440\&merges=0). But I'm active reporting bugs and try to deliver something helpful.

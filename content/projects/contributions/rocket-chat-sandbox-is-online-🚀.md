The main work was already done by another GitHub user in Mid of 2016. Later I've forked this [local\_rocketchat](https://github.com/adpe/moodle-local_rocketchat) repository and worked on it. To complete the integration I've also created a [block\_rocketchat](https://github.com/adpe/moodle-block_rocketchat) which can be added to a Moodle course.

I would really like to spend time on this project during my job, but the idea was no longer pursued. So I've only spent short time on it. There would be so much stuff to improve. Feel free to contribute! üë®‚Äçüíª

For all of you which want to see it in action. Please visit the Moodle sandbox platform <https://moodle.adrianperez.me>.

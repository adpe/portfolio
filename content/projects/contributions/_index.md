### Why Open-source?
Here you can see an overview of projects I am involved in. Why I am interested in open-source projects is mainly the motivation to grow personally.

But here are some other points what open-source means:

- Great way to learn how to code.
- It's fun, it should be a hobby.
- You can give something back.

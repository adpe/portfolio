      <description>What is Moodle? Moodle is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators and learners with a single robust, secure and integrated system to create personalised learning environments.
Why Moodle? Due to my professional activity, my interest in this open source project has increased. I try to get involved in this community as much as possible.
For all interested developers there is a Telegram Moodle Dev Chat.</description>
